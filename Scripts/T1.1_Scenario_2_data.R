# T1.1: Data simulation for scenario 2: bias and error in fecundity #

## MAKE SURE ALL SIMULATIONS ARE 25 YEARS - can then reduce for Scenario 3

#### Set up ####

# load packages

# load any data

#### Simulation 1: measurement error in survival ####

#### Simulation 2: measurement error in fecundity ####

#### Simulation 3: measurement error in both ####

#### Simulation 4: measurement error in continuous variable ####
